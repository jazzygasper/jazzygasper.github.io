        <h1>who is she?</h1>
        <p id="about-top">My name is Jazzy, a creative junior developer/software engineer <br>who is excited and enthusiastic about the potential of technology.
          I'm someone who wants to bulding things that change the world.</p>
        <p>After recently graduating from Central Saint Martins and discovering my passion for coding,
          I invested a lot of time and effort at Makers Academy to develop my programming skills.
          I am now an ambitious coder and looking for a role that will help me grow as a developer.</p>
        <p>Since joining Makers Academy I've started playing Magic the Gathering which I beileve has helped
          me become a coder. In magic and coding it’s vital to keep a view of the overall picture whilst also paying attention
          to the detail of the card you’re playing/the test you’re passing. There are also similarities in the new card you have to learn in the game
          the constantly changing technologies and frameworks.</p>
        <p>I'm also an avid watcher of RuPaul's Drag Race. I believe in building a community in one's work place.
          At Makers Academy I organised "RuPaul Tuesdays" where we would put coding aside and come together to watch a new episode every week.
          I love the creativity that drag queens have and they aspire me to be different and daring in everything I do.</p>
        <p>I like to live an active and healthy lifestyle. I've been playing field hockey since high school through university, and am currently looking
          for a London based club to join. My lastest obsession has been roller skating and hulahooping, I'm hoping
          one day I'll be able to do both at the same time! One of my greatest accomplishment has been completing the Hackney Half Maraton
          with a time of 2 hours 15 minutes. To have done the training and finished the race really proved to me that I have the drive and determination to do
          anything I put my mind to.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <h3>Design</h3>
          <p>At Central Saint Martins I majored in BA Graphic Design, specializing in Design and Interaction,
            with a focus on digital media and marketing. I am meticulous, with a keen visual sense and focus on getting the details correct.
            I believe my creativity and appreciation of visual aesthetics helps me to create beautiful and clean code.
            I'm not just a coder executing a brief, I am also full of ideas and motivated to create amazing experiences for different people.</p>

          <img id="playfest-img" src="app/img/playfest-screenshot.png">
          <p id="playfest-intro">Playfest is an app in which the user can take a picture via their phone camera of a festival
            or concert poster, log in to Spotify and get a playlist with the top ten songs of artists displayed
            on that festival poster. The back end is built with Express and Node.js, and the front end with Ionic
            which uses AngularJS. Our app uses an optical character recognition (OCR) API and the spotify API.</p><br>
        <h2 id="playfest-challenges">Challenges</h2>
          <p>One challenge we faced was figuring out how our app could recognise which words on the poster were
            relevant to creating our playlists. We tried a few approaches, for example identifying the festival by
            location or dates and using the Songkick API to cross check the festival and then find relevant artists.
            However, because there is no consistency in the appearance and format of this information from one poster
            to the next, none of these strategies produced a reliable solution. We overcame this hurdle when we realised
            that our OCR software could also recognise the relative size of the text displayed on the page and therefore,
            since big acts are usually represented with larger text, we could tailor our code to identify those prominent
            artists. Right now, the OCR is not perfect (for example, it cannot recognise some artists due to warped fonts),
            but we feel happy we've reached a workable solution and will strive to keep improving our app.</p>
