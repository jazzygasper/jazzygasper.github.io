    <h1>Jazzy Gasper</h1>
      <p>A creative junior developer/software engineer who is excited and enthusiastic about the potential of technology.
        After<br>recently graduating from Central Saint Martins and discovering my passion for coding,
        I invested a lot of time and effort at<br>Makers Academy to develop my programming skills.
        I am now an ambitious coder and looking for a role that will help me<br>grow as a developer.</p>
    <h2>Skills</h2>
    <h3>Design</h3>
      <p>At Central Saint Martins I majored in BA Graphic Design, specializing in Design and Interaction,
        with a focus on digital<br>media and marketing. I am meticulous, with a keen visual sense and focus on getting the details correct.
        I believe my<br>creativity and appreciation of visual aesthetics helps me to create beautiful and clean code.
        I'm not just a coder executing a<br>brief, I am also full of ideas and motivated to create amazing experiences for different people.</p>
